Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest \nthat increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the \npast two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of \nservice, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of\nservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the \ndescriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the\nweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians\nto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..\nOne these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services\nrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single\nfigure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to \n87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some \nexploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find \nexplanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical\nregions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey\ndata for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most\nimportant of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - \nactivities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and\nrecommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate \nfor the Medical Library Association.."}, "218": {"id": "218", "title": "The National Biomedical Communications Network as a Developing Structure", "author": "Davis, Ruth M.", "content": "The National Biomedical Communications Network has evolved both from a set \nof conceptual recommendations over the last twelve years and an accumulation\nof needs manifesting themselves in the requests of members of the medical \ncommunity..

Description of a system for the production of a book catalog for an \nundergraduate library, using an IBM 1401 Computer (12K storage, 4 tape drives),\nan expanded print chain on the 1403 Printer, and an 029 Card Punch for input..\nDescribed are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable \nform, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing \nof the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author\ntitle catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are \nissued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is \nthe abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of \nentries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols \nemployed to alter this order, and problems encountered.. Cost factors involved \nin the preparation of the catalog are summarized.."}, "849": {"id": "849", "title": "The Development and Administration of automated systems \nin Academic Libraries", "author": "De Gennardo, Richard", "content": "The first part of this paper considers three general approaches to the\ndevelopment of an automation program in a large research library..

Time's passage has replaced the\nmonarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost \nhas attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs\nmay stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the \nprofession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost \naccounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few\nsimple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in\nshort - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.\n  In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related\nprocedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success\nover the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the \nfindings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of \nyour own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate \nrequirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the \nsix steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to \nidentifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, \nthese ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful \nfor your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future."}, "939": {"id": "939", "title": "The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation", "author": "Dougherty, R", "content": "The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless\narticles written within the past decade will attest.

In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought\nthey faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional\nand supporting areas.

And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly\nexpressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed\nutilization of existing manpower.\n  It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R.
